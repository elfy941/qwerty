Our project will be an "online interview platform" . The name is now yet chosen. 
The platform will be splited into two parts , a user part (the one that can apply to interviews , and can sustain interviews) , an a company part (where companies can create jobs , and add interview tests.)

	The flow of the project is the following : 
		A user creates an account on the platform , with his personal data(email , phone , etc.).After the creation of the account , he will receive an e-mail with his account password , than he can log-in into the platform . 

		He will have a special area on the platform where he can modify his account data , and stuff. He will be able also to complete a CV , it is actually required , in order to apply for different companies.

		Once our user have his CV ready , he will be able to see the job offers , from diffrent companie , so he can apply to whatever company he desires . 

		After the application , he will receive a notification if the company have chosen him for the possible job. After that he will be able to sustain the job interview online . The job interview will be composed by theoretical and practical question , from the desired domain of study . Some kind of security measures will be necesary in order to prevent the actual cheating of the user .


		Beside the user part , our platform wil contain also , the company side , where companies can create job offers , can propose interview questions and problems . Also they will receive notifications when users will apply for different jobs . And they can select the users that they desire to participate on their interviews.

		The platform will have of course an administrative side , witch will be controlled by the internal admins , witch they will be able to manage both the users and the companies that will apply on the platform .
